                            </p>
                            <h3>History</h3>
                            <p> The Premier League was formed in 1992 when the top clubs in the Football
                                League First Division broke away to capitalize on lucrative television rights deals.
                                The league started with 22 clubs, but this was reduced to 20 clubs in
                                the 1995-96 season to align with other major European leagues.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Structure</h3>
                            <p>
                                There are 20 teams in the Premier League. Each team plays 38 matches per season (19 home
                                and 19 away).The season runs from August to May, with each team playing every other team
                                twice.Teams receive three points for a win, one point for a draw, and no points for a
                                loss. The team with the most points at the end of the season is crowned the champion.
